            I am a PhD student co-advised by
            <a href="https://wise.ece.cmu.edu/about.html" target="_blank">Anthony Rowe</a>
            and <a href="https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/people.html" target="_blank">Carlee Joe-Wong</a>
            at the Department of <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.

            I'm interested in <b>Learning for Systems</b>: applying machine learning to (cyber-physical) systems in ways that leverage both data-driven learning techniques and a theoretical and intuitive understanding of system properties.

            Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin in May 2021. While at UT Austin, I worked on Learning to Optimize research with

            <b>Data-Driven Edge Orchestration for Distributed Systems</b>
            <br>
            The ability to execute programs in heterogeneous distributed environments while maintaining security and performance isolation is of critical importance as edge and cloud applications become increasingly entangled.
            The <a href="https://github.com/SilverLineFramework">SilverLine</a> framework is our solution, where we propose using WebAssembly modules as an edge-friendly lighter-weight alternative to virtual machines or containers for maintaining isolation while providing portability.
            <br>                
            In this research project, my goal is to explore learning-enabled building blocks for managing distributed systems. Key concerns include performance analysis and runtime prediction, as well as debugging and anomaly detection. My approach emphasizes going beyond black-box approaches (in both a statistical and a systems sense) using techniques like instrumentation injection and statistical machine learning approaches.

            <b>Novel Applications for Neural Radiance Fields</b>
            <br>
            Since its introduction in 2020, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have garnered increasing attention. Recent advances have moved Neural Radiance Fields closer and closer to true competition with traditional techniques in computer graphics.
            <br>
            I am primarily interested in problems outside the traditional NeRF "canon" (e.g. few-shot, quality), with a focus on using sensors other than traditional cameras, and my current research involves applying NeRF-inspired techniques to radar processing.
            In particular, I take an alternative view of NeRF research: instead of trying to best reconstruct a scene given sensor inputs, what kind of sensor inputs are necessary to reach a given target reconstruction quality, given available computational resources?
