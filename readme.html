        <h1>To Students Looking for MS or Undergraduate Research</h1>

        <p>
            <b>You're not a professor.</b>
            Yes, I'm not a professor, and I being a PhD <i>Student</i>, I do not have a PhD, and therefore should not be addressed as "doctor".
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Seems a bit weird to have a page like this.</b>
            Yes, it's pretty weird. However, I've been getting a lot of even weirder emails from masters and undergraduate students, so here I am.
        </p>

        <div class="p">
        <p>
            <b>Why should I work for you?</b>
            My research area is in the intersection of Machine Learning and computer systems (i.e., SysML), so if you're interested in machine learning,
            but don't want to completely give up more "hands-on" systems work, then this area is for you.
            There are many other research groups and individual PhD students working on SysML here at CMU. What makes my work somewhat unique is
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A focus on Learning <i>For Systems</i> instead of Systems <i>For Learning</i>, and</li>
            <li>An engineering-centric research flavor prioritizing <i>practicality</i> over methodological novelty.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In particular, I work on using machine learning to improve systems (not using systems to improve machine learning as in efficient learning, accelerators, etc.),
            and place a strong emphasis on working on novel <i>problems</i> which often require significant effort to create data collection systems.
            Overall, this means that while strong machine learning fundamentals are still necessary to ensure rigor and correctness, my work is generally systems-heavy and quite applied.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p">
            <b>What kind of work do you have for MS/undergraduate RAs?</b> Projects generally fall into independent projects and component projects.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Independent projects</b>:
                    This is typical in "machine learning"-style undergraduate research projects.
                    Students receive a problem to work on independently, with support from me and other collaborators.
                    The project is generally expected to be able to result in a first author publication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Component projects</b>:
                    These projects are working on a small component in a larger project, usually not on the critical path.
                    Less background is required to get started, but the scope is much smaller than a fully publishable research project.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="p">
        <p>
            <b>What are you looking for in a student?</b>
            When it comes to background, there are three main categories that determining the possible level of contribution (imagine adding your scores from all three).
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <i>Machine Learning background</i>: ML fundamentals, particularly basic ML/stats concepts and            
                mathematical foundations such as probability/analysis and linear algebra/optimization.
                I can teach (and you can self-study) more advanced algorithms, but I will not teach introductory mathematics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Systems background</i>: Computer systems concepts (e.g. introductory operating systems / computer architecture), as well as software engineering practices.
                Students should be confident in their ability to independently write code <code>&#8212;</code> at a high standard <code>&#8212;</code>
                beyond the scope of a typical class assignment (where all software components are pre-planned and neatly laid out).
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Time</i>: No student will have all the background required for a project ahead of time (if you do, why are you emailing <i>me</i>?). Budget at least one semester for "spin-up" before you can 
                do anything meaningful. As a corollary, students with one semester or less remaining should not bother.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Putting these together, when I decide whether or not to take a student, I try to answer one simple question:
            can this student be taught enough about machine learning for systems in time to contribute meaningfully to a research project before they leave CMU?
        </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <b>I'll work for you for free.</b>
            Even if you're working for free, working with you is not <i>free</i>. Free would be deleting all of your emails without reading them.
            Supervising a undergraduate / masters RA is a (time) cost to me, and I also have to do research and graduate eventually.
            Finally, while the undergraduate and masters RAs that I work with are usually paid, whether you get paid or not makes no difference to me since I'm not the one paying.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>I understand and agree to these terms and conditions; how do I apply?</b>
            Please send me an email! I commit to replying to all student emails <code>&#8212;</code> even if it's just to say no.
        </p>
