This summer, I worked at SLD Laser in Fremont, California. While there, I was inspired (in part by my desire to live in the Bay Area) by the architecture of the area; unlike the vast and wide McMansions of Texas, Bay Area homes simply cannot afford to waste space on frivolous detail or crude caricatures of the antebellum south.

With its small, narrow, and hilly plot, this design emulates the style of a typical Bay Area home, with a slight twist. The house is wrapped around a large central courtyard with a tree. In order to make the courtyard have a reasonable size without requiring an excessively large home, one wall of the couryard is shared with the side of the building.

The house is laid out with living spaces on the second floor, with a garage, workshop, and office occupying the first floor. The main entrance is hidden at the side of the building, and leads directly to the courtyard.
