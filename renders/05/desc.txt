This was my first design to specify any sort of interior. No materials are specified, other than grass, to represent green space, water, to depict two water features at the center, and glass.

This uncreatively named (this was my 5th project) three-floor apartment complex features two long rows of two and three-floored units sized somewhere between an apartment unit and a townhouse. At the ends, larger units are intended as mixed-use commercial units.

Around the center courtyard, on one side, intersecting diagonal supports and downwards-leaning windows create a half-enclosed long hall. Combined with the half-floor-aligned green space (which I imagined as a grassy area for small-scale soccer or similar sports), the center courtyard presents a unique concept for an apartment complex common area.
