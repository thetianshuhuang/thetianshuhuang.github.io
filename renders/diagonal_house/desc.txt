This was my first full house design. The house is designed around two separately aligned axes, creating many interesting shapes where these axes interact to create various triangles, trapezoids, and parallelograms.

The roof is fundamentally two slopes from a center ridge line; this roof shape is made more sophisticated by introducing periodic jumps, and two triangular stone towers that rise through the house.

The house features extensive outdoor spaces, including a 1/2-floor-aligned balcony above the 1 1/2-floor high entrance hall clad with stained wood decking. Combined with the black, multifaceted roof geometry, the house presents a simple, yet visually appealing aerial view (which, in my opinion, is far too often neglected by Architects).
