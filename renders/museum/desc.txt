My first design with a fully featured interior. This was my Art History final project; the assignment was to design an Art Museum and describe a collection of art across various periods that would be in it (I might have done a bit of extra work).

The massing and concept was originally conceptualized by a friend in middle school. When I got this assignment, thought I would try to take this idea and fully form it into a complete structure.

The museum is designed in a brutalist style, featuring various patterns of scored concrete arranged in sharp angles. In a slight departure from the brutalist style, the focal point of the museum is a large, glass-walled cube; various floors rise on cylindrical supports inside the cube, but never touch the exterior. In order to add color, the exposed edges of each floor are painted in bright colors, creating a color theme for each floor.
