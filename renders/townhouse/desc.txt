This is my take on an urban townhouse. Freed from the tyranny of the two-car garage, a single parking space and small garage used to store bikes frees the townhouse from having to accomodate the large, awkwardly-sized mass typical of attached suburban garages.

This design is heavily inspired by townhouses in European cities such as Berlin and Amsterdam. Due to the lack of side windows caused by shared walls with adjacent homes, a central "atrium" allows light through the building while also housing the stairs. In order to better save space, floor heights are staggered: the front of the house is raised (or lowered, depending on your perspective) by 1/2 floor height.
