I recently discovered the TV show <i>Grand Designs</i>, a British series showcasing various spec house construction projects. As an excellent source of background noise, I found myself gradually gathering inspiration from the various projects featured on the show. Houses covered in living roofs or partially embedded into hillsides are frequently featured on the show. As such, I wanted to try my hand at designing a hillside house.

Located in a small depression, this house attempts to hide the majority of its mass through usage of a grass roof integrated into the hill. To further hide in its environment, the house uses traditional, unremarkable materials. Light is brought to the bottom floor using a courtyard sunk into the ground, which is surrounded on two sides by the main building, on one side by a separated guest room, and on the last side by a walkway.
