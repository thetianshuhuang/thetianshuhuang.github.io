One of my earliest designs; explores the interaction of various 90-degree-aligned slats of multiple scales. I imagined this as an university building with classrooms on the bottom floors, with offices and labs on the top floors. Although no interior layout is specified, I've always imagined the central section connecting the two arms as a glass-walled atrium with various walkways crossing it from one arm to the next.
